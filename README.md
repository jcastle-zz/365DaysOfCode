# 365DaysOfCode

This repo is a representation of my effort to move from a government program manager to a front-end engineer. My first commercial job after college was in front-end development, then I accepted a job in government and quit working on my technical skills, to many years later dabbling in front-end development once again. My latest role is to be the engineering lead for the Code.gov platform and complete all front-end engineering activities.

Here are a couple supporting docs outside of this repo.
- [Professional resume](https://github.com/jcastle/dissertation_publishingOSS/blob/master/Resume.pdf)
- [Ph.D. dissertation](https://github.com/jcastle/dissertation_publishingOSS/blob/master/Castle_JR_D_2020.pdf) on open source software
- [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jrcastle/)
- [Twitter](https://twitter.com/jrcastle_vt)

My goal here, while trying not to be a workaholic, is to learn as much as possible by coding almost every day for a year. Some days this involves working on one of the Code.gov [14 code bases](https://github.com/GSA/code-gov) to doing an online class to writing javascript programs. 

The following is a collection of coursework and projects beyond Code.gov that support my move to engineering.
